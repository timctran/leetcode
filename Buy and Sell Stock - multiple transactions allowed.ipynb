It's more expensive than current price so we are done. Our total gains has been \\$1. We append `($2, 2)` to the list. Here the quantity is two because represents a future potential of both Day 2 and Day 3. We'll see soon enough. The list is currently `[($5, 1), ($2, 2)]`  \n",
    "> Day 4. Do a check and we see \\$6 is more than the smallest \\$2. Here we have `($6 - $2)*2 = $8` new gain, plus the \\$1 we previously gained, for a total of \\$9 gain. Effectively what has happened is we update our old decision to purchase and sell to \"Purchase Day 2, Sell Day 4\" and a new additional \"Purchase Day 3, Sell Day 4.\" But we're not done. We have to check the next item which is `($5, 1)`. \\$6 is more than \\$5 so we make a purchase-sale and add to our gains. The list is empty and so we append `($6, 4)` to our list. The list is now `[($6, 4)]`.  \n",
